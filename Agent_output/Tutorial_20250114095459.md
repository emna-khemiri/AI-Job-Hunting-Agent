# LangChain and LangGraph Tutorial

This tutorial provides an introduction to LangChain and LangGraph, covering their core concepts and usage with practical Python code examples.

## LangChain

LangChain is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It offers a modular and flexible approach to building LLM-powered applications by providing abstractions for common functionalities.

### Core Concepts

* **LLMs:** LangChain provides a standardized interface to interact with various LLMs, allowing you to easily switch between different providers.
* **Chains:** Chains are sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities. They enable complex workflows by combining multiple components.
* **Indexes:** Indexes structure documents for LLMs to access and process information effectively.
* **Agents:** Agents use LLMs to decide which actions to take, enabling dynamic and interactive applications.
* **Memory:** Memory components allow chains and agents to remember previous interactions, enhancing context and personalization.
* **Callbacks:** Callbacks provide a mechanism to monitor and log the execution of LangChain components.

### Code Example

```python
query = "latest news on generative AI"
print(default_api.duckduckgo_results_json(query=query))

```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use LangChain's `LLMChain` to answer a question using an LLM.

## LangGraph

LangGraph is a tool that allows visualizing and analyzing chains created using LangChain. It helps understand the flow of data and operations within a chain, facilitating debugging and optimization.

### Core Concepts

* **Visual Representation:** LangGraph visually represents chains as graphs, making it easy to grasp their structure.
* **Component Inspection:** It allows inspecting the details of individual components within a chain.
* **Execution Analysis:** LangGraph helps analyze the execution flow of a chain, identifying potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

### Usage

LangGraph can be used to visualize chains created in LangChain, providing insights into their structure and execution. You can integrate LangGraph into your LangChain workflow for better understanding and debugging.
